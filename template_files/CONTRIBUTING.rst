Sign your work
==============

         **Attention:** The following sign-off guidance is based on the
         standard Developer Certificate of Origin. If your project
         requires alternate sign-off guidance, replace the below content
         with your project-specific guidance.

Please use the sign-off line at the end of the patch. Your signature
certifies that you wrote the patch or otherwise have the right to pass
it on as an open-source patch. The rules are pretty simple: if you can
certify the below (from
`developercertificate.org <http://developercertificate.org/>`__):

::
