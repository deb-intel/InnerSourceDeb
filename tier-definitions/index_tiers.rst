Tier Definitions and Levels
###########################

Tier definitions are part of an assessment tool that grades the strength of
your defined project/repo tasks such as architecture, setup, and release
cadence. Tasks that include complete and well-understood actions indicate
lower tier-level grades (Tier 1, 2) while tasks with less or loosely-defined
actions indicate higher tier-level grades (Tier 5, 4). 

Each task listed in this section contains best-practice tier-level
definitions to help incentivize you and your team to keep improving code,
tools, and documentation. It also helps you track progress towards
InnerSource readiness. 

In summary, "readiness" means your project/repo is optmized to support:

* Ease of reuse
* Ease of collaboration
* Ease of contribution
