Participation Ease Of Ramp
##########################

Contribution teams have an easier time learning quickly about the project in order to start contributions. For example: don't have to learn for 8 weeks to make 2-line code change.

Tier Definitions
****************

.. _tier_participationEaseOfRamp_start:

* **Tier 5.** Steep learning curve. Minimal or no documentation accessible. Hard for new developers to make even small code changes.
* **Tier 4.** High-level architecture and engineering design decisions are documented. Data flow schema (block schema with interconnection between modules) or high-level architecture decision on solution.
* **Tier 3.** Clear responsibility and engineering design choices for individual components documented. Easy to navigate the code for contributors to find where to put changes.
* **Tier 2.** Well-defined workflow as well as roles and responsibilities documented. Discoverable list of starter issues. Examples of starter issues: non-critical, low priority, and easy issues that are ideal for new contributors to fix.
* **Tier 1.** Practical extensibility which follows language or frawework guidelines. Reference language or framework guidelines in documentation. Typical extension points are defined and well documented.
