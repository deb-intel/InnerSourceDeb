Create a Security Policy File
=============================

Security Policies provide contributors with information on how to report security vulnerabilites within a project. The Security Policy can contain as little information as asking contributors to file a GitHub Issue, or it can include known issues or security advisories for the latest release. 

Download the sample :download:`SECURITY POLICY template</template_files/SECURITY.md>`. Keep in mind the following checklist as you prepare your own: 

# Security Policy Location

- [ ] Add a Security Policy to your repository by adding SECURITY.md to the root repo or .github folder. Refer to [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/getting-started/adding-a-security-policy-to-your-repository) for information.

# Report Vulnerabilities

- [ ] Submit bug reports to the GitHub Issues page.
  - Provide as much info as possible. Refer to Intel's [Reporting a Vulnerability](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/security/security-practices/vulnerability-management/reporting-vulnerability.html) for assistance.
  - Use Intel's [Vulnerability Handling Guidelines] (https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/security-center/vulnerability-handling-guidelines.html) as an additional resource.

# Known Issues and Security Advisories

- [ ] Add Known Issues or Security Advisories for a recent release if any exists. Refer to GitHub Docs on creating [Security Advisories](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/repository-security-advisories/about-github-security-advisories-for-repositories).
