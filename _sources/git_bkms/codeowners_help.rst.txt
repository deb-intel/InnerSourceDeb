Add CODEOWNERS
###############

The CODEOWNERS file defines individuals or teams who maintain the repo. This
ensures that members or teams who are responsible for the accuracy of
technical content are alerted to additions and/or modifications to source
code and documentation.

Download the sample :download:`CODEOWNERS template</template_files/CODEOWNERS.md>`. Keep in mind 
the following checklist as you prepare your own: 

# Location
- [ ] Create a CODEOWNERS file.

  - Place the file in the root, docs/, or .github/ directory of a given repo.
  - If you have separate repos for source code and documentation, consider creating a CODEOWNERS file for each repo. 

# Define administrators, maintainers, and code owners
- [ ] Provide a list of code owners.

  - The CODEOWNERS file does not include the following optional information. If useful, consider adding it to your contribution guidelines: 

- [ ] Provide a list of admins and maintainers.
- [ ] Define who can approve Pull Requests. 
- [ ] Define who can merge Pull Requests.
- [ ] Define who can publish the website if one is available.
