Development environment setup
#############################

In order to attract contribution, a project should enable a developer to setup a productive development environment as simply and quickly as possible.

Tier Definitions
****************

The following levels of readiness have been defined;

.. _tier_developmentSetup_start:

* **Tier 5.** Undocumented or lacks clear development setup. For example a new developer has to find missing tools and compile them in order to start development.
* **Tier 4.** Custom or outdated build utilities and/or testing frameworks, e.g. Karma test-runner, Python 2, Selenium E2E testing, etc.
* **Tier 3.** An up to date, well documented, development setup. A README, or other document, contains comprehensive setup instructions. None of the tools or frameworks are deprecated or unmaintained.
* **Tier 2.** Easy and flexible development setup. For example a developer can setup the development environment via a script, a docker container, or preconfigured VM. The documentation covers not only setup but also defines constraints, e.g. which compilers are supported.
* **Tier 1.** One-Click development setup, e.g. Github workspace.
