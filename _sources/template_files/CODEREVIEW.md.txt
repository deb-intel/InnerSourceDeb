CODEREVIEW
==========

# Architecture
- [ ] Is the code modular?

# Design
- [ ] Does code follow existing codebase conventions? 

# Readability
- [ ] Are function names easy to understand?
- [ ] Are variable names easy to understand or intuitive? 

# Comments
- [ ] Are comments included, especially for dense or convoluted functions?

# Functionality
- [ ] Does form follow function (e.g., Is there just enough, or too much, detail to assist future developers)? 
- [ ] Is there a balance between functional performance and ease-of-use?

# Errors & Exceptions
- [ ] What is the approach to error handling in the code?
- [ ] Does exception handling work as designed (or is it managed with tests)? 
- [ ] Are exceptions handled with clear failure scenarios?

# Security
- [ ] Have you identified impacts on security or trust boundaries in code? 
- [ ] Have security implications been considered or addressed?

# Automation
- [ ] Linting tools available? integrated?
- [ ] Do CI/CD solutions support, or extend, native code capabilities?

# Testing
- [ ] Have unit tests, functional tests, or integration tests been developed?
- [ ] Is a test-bench, or test-harness, used? Does it requirement inclusion of specific hardware or software?
