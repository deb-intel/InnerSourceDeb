## InnerSource Methodology

Many companies use the word “innersource” to describe how their engineering teams work together on code.
Innersource is a development methodology where engineers build proprietary software using best practices
from large-scale open source projects, like Kubernetes or Microsoft’s Visual Studio Code.

Large-scale open source projects require coordination and teamwork across thousands of contributors. The
most successful ones are driven by a vision for their future, in addition to day-to-day user needs: speed,
reliability, and functionality. The scale at which these operate can teach us a few lessons—and help your
business build better software, faster using innersource.
