Software Legal Compliance (SWLC)

The InnerSource community of practice does not define or interfere with the corporate Software Legal Compliance requirements.
- SWLC Sharepoint: http://goto.intel.com/swlc
- SWLC Wiki: https://wiki.ith.intel.com/display/SWLC/Software+Legal+Compliance
- SWLC Record Center: http://goto.intel.com/SWLCRecordCenter

We recommend teams also scan for Intellectual Property Leak Detection.

The InnerSource community of practice would like to see the following ensure InnerSource readiness for reuse and contribution:
- In your InnerSource YAML file, please record the location of your Protex project and how to get access.
  - Provide list of obligations that product reusing this code should fulfill.
- In your InnerSource YAML file, please record the location of your SWLC Record Center project and how to get access.
  - Up-to-date SWLC evidence can easily be shared
- Obtain Software Legal Compliance approval (ex: Protex, Intellectual Property (IP) Plan, Open Source PDT, Export Compliance, etc.)
- Record Center approved (TODO: add details ex: "all evidence is approved" - Ask Legal)
