# Open Source PDT (OSPDT) Approval

The InnerSource community of practice does not define or interfere with the corporate Open Source PDT Approval requirements.
- https://opensource.intel.com/how-to/open-source-approval-process

The InnerSource community of practice would like to see the following ensure InnerSource readiness for reuse and contribution:
- Protex BOM
  - Ensure all 3rd party license dependencies are captured in your Protex project
  - Ensure you have populated the "Usage" field correctly for every item in your Protex project
    - https://wiki.ith.intel.com/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=SWLC&title=Component+Usages
- In your InnerSource YAML file, record the link to your OSPDT Aproval JIRA ticket
  - TODO: Not open access
  - Open: Does record center capture this?
