The InnerSource community of practice aligns with the OneDatabase effort for Requirement & Bug tracking.
https://intel.sharepoint.com/sites/1s1d/SitePages/One-Database.aspx

While the OneDatabase tool implementation and migration are ongoing, we reccommend documenting the following in your InnerSource YAML file:
- Link to current requirement & bug tracking tool
- Access request details for current requirement & bug tracking tool
- Link to feature requests (ex: JIRA query)
- Link to response time definition for your project

For features: ensure they are open, searchable, archived discussion, clear yes/no, features slotted to releases (similar to github issues)
