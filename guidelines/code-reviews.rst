Code Reviews
############

Code reviews are an integral part of software development in any team. This document provides guidance to
new or junior-level developers in conducting code reviews. 


Templates
*********

Templates are included for those who wish to organize code reviews.
It\'s expected that users modify templates or focus only sections relevant to their specific
software solution.


* `Code Review cheat-sheet <CODE_REVIEW.md>`   
* `Code Plan cheat-sheet <CODE_PLAN.md>`

**Linear Flow**
- Where does code/vars start? 
- What is the path of data? 
- How are parameters passed from one function to another (specific order)
- How/Are parameters shared?
- What defines success? 
- What defines failure (and is this done gracefully)?

**Atomic Flow**
- How Classess instantiate objects that are needed to process data
- Which Class instantiation dependencies exist (outside scope of code)
- Which groups are involved in contributing to the codebase? What is the group's scope of responsibility in the codebase
