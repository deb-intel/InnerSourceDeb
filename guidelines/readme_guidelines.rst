Guildelines for Creating Readme Files
#####################################

The README file is the "front door" to your repository. It is likely the first page a new user will see. It should communicate the most important information about your project clearly and concisely.

GitHub will automatically display the README file as the repository home page.
Avoid making the reader scroll and scroll and scroll to reach the desired
content. If sections in your README are getting too long, consider moving the
content into a separate page and linking to it from the README or using the
repository wiki.

For example, add a section to your README for the content that includes a
simple statement linking to the full content on a separate page. The License
section in this README example demonstrates this.
