Open Source PDT (OSPDT) Approval
################################

The InnerSource community of practice does not define or interfere with the corporate `Open Source PDT Approval requirements`_.

The InnerSource community of practice would like to see the following ensure InnerSource readiness for reuse and contribution:

- Protex BOM

  - Ensure all 3rd party license dependencies are captured in your Protex project

  - Ensure you have populated the "Usage" field correctly for every item in your `Protex project`_.

- In your InnerSource YAML file, record the link to your OSPDT Aproval JIRA ticket

  - TODO: Not open access

  - Open: Does record center capture this?
