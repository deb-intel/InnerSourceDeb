# Global Trade Complance (Export)

The InnerSource community of practice does not define or interfere with the corporate Global Trade Compliance requirements.
- Sharepoint: https://intel.sharepoint.com/sites/Trade/SitePages/Export-Classification-Number-(ECCN).aspx

The InnerSource community of practice would like to see the following ensure InnerSource readiness for reuse and contribution:
- Document your Export Compliance Classifcation Number (ECCN) and your country of origin in Record Center
- In your InnerSource YAML file, please record your "Row ID" and/or "Release Name" from PCQ database (http://goto.intel.com/PCQ-view)

For teams reusing code:
- If you are not modifying the code, you can reference the existing Export Compliance Classifcation Number (ECCN) approval when obtaining the ECCN for your project.
- If you are modifying the code, you are responsible for obtaining a new Export Compliance Classifcation Number (ECCN) through the following methods.
  - SDLE Auto-classification
  - Product Classification Questionaire Submission (http://goto.intel.com/PCQ)
  - At-A-Glance can be used when changes are limited to the specific categories only (https://goto.intel.com/gt-release-revisioning) 
- If you want the review the original ECCN submission, you can email the Export Classification <export.classification@intel.com> with the Row ID and they can send you the data
