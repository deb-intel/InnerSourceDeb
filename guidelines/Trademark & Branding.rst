Trademark & Branding (TM&B)
===========================

The InnerSource community of practice does not define or interfere with the corporate Trademark & Branding requirements, for more details visit https://legal.intel.com/Trademarks/

The InnerSource community of practice would like to see the following ensure InnerSource readiness for reuse and contribution:
- In your your InnerSource YAML file, document the name of your project as recorded in Trademark & Brand data base (Internal code name and/or external product name)
- Have you received Trademark & Brand clearance? 
  - No – guidance to do this https://legal.intel.com/Trademarks/Pages/tm%20cpor.aspx and include current unapproved name
  - Yes – Record direct link to TM&B DB entry in your InnerSource YAML file
- If applicable, please document your historic other names in your InnerSource YAML file.
