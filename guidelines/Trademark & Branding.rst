Trademark & Branding (TM&B)
===========================

The InnerSource community of practice does not define or interfere with the corporate Trademark & Branding requirements, for more details visit https://legal.intel.com/Trademarks/

The InnerSource community of practice would like to see the following ensure InnerSource readiness for reuse and contribution:

- External projects or projects that will go external:
  - In your your InnerSource YAML file, document the name of your project as recorded in Trademark & Brand data base (Internal code name and/or external product name)
  - Have you received Trademark & Brand clearance?
    - No – Guidance to do this https://legal.intel.com/Trademarks/Pages/tm%20cpor.aspx and include current unapproved name
    - Yes – Record direct link to TM&B DB entry in your InnerSource YAML file
- Internal only projects
  - In your your InnerSource YAML file, document the name of your project
  - Did you follow "Open Source Project and Repo Naming Process" https://opensource.intel.com/node/2226?
    - No - For InnerSource, we recommend you follow this process reguardless of whether you will be open source or not and whether you will be externally released or not
    - Yes - You will need to follow TM&B guidelines if you change to external release
- If applicable, please document your historic other names in your InnerSource YAML file.
