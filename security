Security Development Lifecycle

The InnerSource community of practice does not define or interfere with the corporate Security Development Lifecycle requirements.
SDL Sharepoint: http://goto.intel.com/sdl
SDL Essentials portal: http://goto.intel.com/sdle
SDL Wiki: http://goto.intel.com/sdle-wiki

The InnerSource community of practice would like to see the following ensure InnerSource readiness for reuse and contribution:
- In your InnerSource YAML file, please record the location of your SDL project and how to get access.
- Code marked as shippable (release tags) has 100% of SDL tasks complete in your SDL project.
- 2 weeks SLA for addressing CVEs reported against current and LTS versions of the component.
- Compliant with Intel PSIRT policy â€“ all critical/ medium severity PSIRTs have been fixed or are within the acceptable fix window. PSIRT database and records are usually restricted by need-to-know.
