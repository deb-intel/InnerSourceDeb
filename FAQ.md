# FAQ - InnerSource @ Intel

## What does InnerSource mean?

- The use of open source software development best practices and the establishment of an open source-like culture within organizations.
- The organization may still develop proprietary software, but internally opens up its development.

Many companies use the word "InnerSource" to describe how their engineering teams work together on code. InnerSource is a development methodology where engineers build proprietary software using best practices from large-scale open source projects.  The use of open source software development best practices and the establishment of an open source like culture within OISA, IAGS and eventually across Intel is what InnerSource @ Intel is all about.

## What do people in our industry have to say about InnerSource?

> Intel needs to change to survive and change even more to win. We need to move from reactive software execution to software leading the way for our hardware roadmap. We need to break down the fragmented software silos across Intel and create unified and simple software solutions for the corporation. Reimagining the role of software at Intel is central to the transformation of Intel.
> - Bill Savage, One Intel Software & Architecture Sept'2020 All Hands

> Adopting this modern approach to software development can be transformative—enabling collaboration and fostering the creation of high quality code. But understanding the principles, and potential challenges, is critical to success.  Many companies use the word “innersource” to describe how their engineering teams work together on code. Innersource is a development methodology where engineers build proprietary software using best practices from large-scale open source projects, like Kubernetes or Microsoft’s Visual Studio Code.

> We see innersource as a way to improve efficiency through code reuse. But even beyond that, it's an amazing conduit for learning and exchanging ideas and facilitating innovation within IBM.

## What are some Industry Resources about InnerSource?

- [InnerSource Commons](https://innersourcecommons.org/): ISC is a growing community of practitioners with the goal of creating and sharing knowledge about InnerSource: the use of open source best practices for software development within the confines of an organization. Founded in 2015, the InnerSource Commons is now supporting and connecting over seventy companies, academic institutions, and government agencies

## Why Now?

As businesses like Intel's evolve and they seek to differentiate their products and services with software and data they quickly realize that traditional development methods and tooling don’t quite work. The slow, systematic practice of gathering requirements, holding meetings, and developing in silos is not in step with the pace of technology today—or even the pace of customer demands.  Sound familiar?  Intel needs to shift to InnerSource culture in order to
- Maximize efficiency while keeping customer focus
- Avoid duplication of work
- Share and align on best practices
- Increase speed and productivity of development
- Scale software
- Keep up with our competitors
- Encourage contribution

InnerSource helps teams build software faster and work better together—resulting in higher-quality development and better documentation. It also can help companies become more efficient by:

- Making it easy to find and reuse code on a broad scale, avoiding wasted resources and duplication
- Driving rapid development, regardless of company size
- Reducing silos and simplifying collaboration throughout the entire organization—inside and between teams and functions, as well as across teams and business lines
- Increasing clarity between engineers and management, as well as anyone else who’s interested
- Creating a culture of openness, a precursor to open source participation
- Reinforcing the pride, growth, and job satisfaction felt by team members who help wherever there is a need
