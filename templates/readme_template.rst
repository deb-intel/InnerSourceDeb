# Security

**Note:** All Intel-managed open source projects are required to provide clear,
easy to find instructions for how to responsibly report a security issue or
vulnerability.

**Recommended:** Link to the Intel vulnerability reporting policy at
intel.com/security

**Alternative:** Projects can create their own method if the following basic
handling requirements are met:

- Private means of reporting security issues
- Must retain all communication records even if report is not validated
- Once a reported issue is validated, the project team will follow the
  process documented at intel.com/security to have a CVE assigned.

Instructions for security/vulnerability reporting can be documented in the
README or CONRIBUTING files. If this information is not provided in the README
or CONTRIBUTING files, use a separate SECURITY or HACKING file.
