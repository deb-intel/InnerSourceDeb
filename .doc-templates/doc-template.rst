Prerequisites
*************

If applicable, add any prerequisites. Otherwise, remove section.

Process
*******

If applicable, define when to follow this practice. If applicable, define the larger context where this practice fits.  

Sub-section
===========

Use `sub-section` if applicable; otherwise, remove it.

Sub-sub-section

Use `Sub-sub-section` if applicable; otherwise, remove it.

BKMs
*****

What is the recommended practice? Revise the header above as necessary.
When you define a concept, add at least one concrete example, or implementation, of its use.

Governance
**********

If applicable, add details. Otherwise, remove section.
Does governance play a role in understanding this concept? For example, if this concept
cross-references the `maintainers-setup` or `development-setup`, add details or relevant links to those docs.

Tier Definitions
****************

If applicable, add a Tier Definitions section. Refer to InnerSource Readiness Collateral for latest Tier Definitions if this is the first draft. 
After first addition of Tier Definitions, the Docs team will discuss and drive improvements of these definitions and bring back issues to larger InnerSource WG.

- Use tier definitions as a bulleted list (5 - 1).

- Use the "bookend" method shown below, where:
  - `_tier_category_start` is the first bookend.
  - `_tier_category_end` is the last bookend.
  - `<category name>` matches the specific category name in the InnerSource Readiness Collateral. Replace category name with the relevant category that the doc addresses.

- Note: Only bookend the content; don\'t enclose any headers or sub-headers.

.. code-block:: bash
    
   .. _tier_<category name>_start:

         Tier descriptions ...


   .. _tier_<category name>_end:

If tier definitions do not apply, remove this section.

Next Steps
**********

If this practice is part of a larger workflow, you may include relevant hyperlinks to doc(s) in a bulleted list.
Keep bulleted items short.  Otherwise, remove this section.
