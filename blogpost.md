# Why InnerSource at Intel?

## InnerSource Origins

When Tim O'Reilly coined the phrase "InnerSource" in 2000, a quiet revolution began. At the Open Source Summit two years before, O'Reilly engaged a team of IBM developers interested in adopting open source values to accelerate development (2018). The theory went, by adopting open source principles, companies like IBM could apply open source principles inside their own walls. Regardless of whether code was publicly released.

Companies could promote "collaboration, community, and low barriers to entry" with InnerSource, helping achieve faster development cycles--promoting peer-reviewed code (O'Reilly). It was the Internet 1.0 era. Distributed development was new. Git, a version control system Linus Torvalds created to support Linux kernel development, wouldn't be born for another five years (2005).     

Suddenly, the rigid "waterfall model" from the 1960s was forced to contend with the World Wide Web and distributed communities. As "open source" software development gained momentum, so did InnerSource.  Its practice revolutionized the way software was made inside companies.
