# Why InnerSource at Intel?

## InnerSource Origins

When Tim O'Reilly coined the phrase "InnerSource", in 2000, a quiet revolution began. In 1998 at the Open Source Summit, O'Reilly engaged a team of IBM developers who were interested in adopting open source values within an organization to accelerate development (O'Reilly). The theory went, by adopting open source principles, companies like IBM could apply open source principles inside their own walls. They could foster "collaboration, community, and low barriers to entry," helping them achieve faster development cycles--promoting peer-reviewed code (O'Reilly). These were the heady days of the Internet 1.0. Distributed development teams were relatively new. Git, a version control system Linus Torvalds invented to support Linux kernel development, wouldn't be born for another five years (2005).     

Against that backdrop, the practice of InnerSource began to take shape. The rigid "waterfall model," which began in the late 1960s, was forced to contend with the World Wide Web and distributed communities. The "open source" software development model would revolutionize the way software was made.

## Why InnerSource matters

InnerSource is still relevant, more than 20 years later. Some of the early adopters of InnerSource, including Microsoft, now rely on this development model. Agile development, scrum masters, and kanban boards are the new norm. 

In 2022, Intel made a formal commitment to incorporate InnerSource culture. The InnerSource Work Group (WG), led by Project Manager Aaryn Curl, includes individuals from IT, DevOPs, Release Engineering, and Documentation teams. This blogpost introduces the InnerSource Portal, an aggregator app with maturity metrics and tier definitions, which are integral to helping teams assess their ability to employ InnerSource practices. By using the Portal app, Intel teams add their projects, start leveraging the work of other teams, review metrics, and slowly incorporate InnerSource principles. One step at a time.

## What is InnerSource? 

In the book "Adopting InnerSource," the authors claim:
> [InnerSource is [...] the use of Open Source principles and practices inside proprietary organizations. 
> InnerSource empowers individual engineers to contribute code from within their team to another team in order to speed up the
> process of adding functionality (features) or fixing defects.

## The InnerSource Portal 

The [InnerSource Portal](https://inner-source.intel.com/board/root) was created to aggregate repos and project data across Intel with the intention of promoting reuse and transparency. 1Source and InnerSource are two stages in the same development process, as we explain in the [InnerSource Overview](https://probable-fiesta-6f2be87d.pages.github.io/overview/innersource_overview.html)

Since early 2022, Intel has a seen a shift toward using "OKRs" to track corporate- and individual-level performance. This "revived" assessment model emphasizes transparency, accountability, and most importantly, measureable and verifiable metrics. The InnerSource Portal establishes similar metrics. And for similar reasons. We must ask: How can we in Intel SATG, as a software-centric organization, hold ourselves accountable without first establishing baseline data for project and repo "health"? That's where InnerSource Portal comes in.

## InnerSource Philosophy

Our philosophy is simple. 

> Adopt. Adapt. Accelerate.

If teams across Intel **adopt** InnerSource principles, they increase the possibility of reuse; they promote greater transparency and the ability to collaborate. When teams **adapt** other teams' tools, processes, and code to suit their own needs, they don't have to reinvent the wheel. With that time savings, teams can dedicate their efforts to feature development or whatever their highest priority. When the previous two criteria are met, teams **accelerate** code development across Intel. We increase the possibility of greater reuse by encouraging cross-pollination and collaboration. We endorse a force multiplier.

This causal relationship means we need to reach a "critical mass" stage where enough projects are added, before we can see optimal reuse across Intel.
The InnerSource WG hopes to add at leat 75 new project to the Portal by the end of 2022. Or exceed that number. 

## Why use the InnerSource Portal?

The Portal Assessment provides a self-paced instruction that asks you to evaluate key characteristics of your project's innersource readiness, such as how well you define software "architecture", provide a "roadmap", support "versioning", manage "releases", and encourage participation by "ease-of-ramp"--among others. In collaboration with IoTG, the InnerSource WG, worked hard to define key categories, which are the basis to determine a Tier Level (1-5, where 1 is highest) and Maturity (1-5, where 4 or 5 is highest). By discovering a project's Tier Level and Maturity, teams can quickly understand how to better achieve InnerSource principles. For example, teams can indicate that they're "accepting contributions."

The assumption here is that all repos and projects across Intel should strive for a best-in-class codebase, which is modular, reusable, and extensible. We recognize this process takes time.  In turn, the Assessment task in the app provides a completely free way to establish baseline data, which then can be used to show project evolution over time.

## Conclusion

The opportunity cost is too great to risk losing the chance to increase collaboration, reuse, and transparency, which ultimately enriches the products we offer our customers. Arguably, the the more coherent and unified our sofware projects are, the more time we can then devote to providing our clients with innovative software solutions. Whether these are XPU development frameworks, like [Intel oneAPI Toolkits](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/oneapi-toolkits-xpu-software-development.html), or future growth in [quantum computing] (https://circuit.intel.com/content/news/circuitnews/corporate/2020/ww36-quantum.html), solutions that support a "Customer First" approach. Further, this fundamental shift in adopting "innersource" culture directly maps to other Intel values: *Fearless Innovation*, *Results Driven*, *Integrity*, and *Quality*.

The more projects added to the Portal, the richer our collective data. The richer the data, the greater the possibility for collaboration, contribution, and cross-pollination from those external to the originating group. Why is this valuable--especially for SATG? The answer is twofold. 

First, the Portal app serves to aggregate repos and projects, exposing their resources to others and encouraging reuse. We want to move toward reuse and automation while avoiding coveted silos of code. Second, by filling out a Portal "Assessment", team members create a baseline of data that reflects current "project health", or "innersource readiness."  Without this baseline data, projects across Intel have no standardized way to evaluate our ability to reuse code and track our maturity.
